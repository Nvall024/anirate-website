Anirate is an online platform for users to rate, comment, and converse about favorite anime titles. Users can create their own account and have their comments saved under each title for others to see. A special section for anime characters will allow users to also talk about their favorite characters. 

## Technologies Used:

Anirate is a web development project, so the use of HTML and CSS is prevalent. For the back end, Java alongside JSP files is used. Apache Tomcat is used to host our website and run the Java files.
